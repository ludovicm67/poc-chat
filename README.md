## Quick start

Make sure you have Elixir and NodeJS installed on your machine.

Then just run `make` to install all required dependencies.

## Run it!

The best part, yay!

So here a list of commands you can run:
 - `run-server`: run the Elixir server (no prompts)
 - `run-dev-server`: run the Elixir server using `iex`, nice for debugging
 - `run-nodejs-client`: run the NodeJS client. Should be run after a server.

Have fun! :-)
